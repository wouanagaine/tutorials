# Introduction #

Here is a quick guide to get familiar with **craft ai**.

The material for this tutorial is a web application that will browse
[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) topics and match the titles to the names of
state capitals from all over the world. When there is a match, the application
will connect to the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) API, retrieve
the current weather for the corresponding capital and display it on a map.

## Getting ready ##

### Requirements ###

- A modern browser such as Chrome 45, Firefox 39 or Safari 9,
- A GitHub account.

### Forking the GitHub repository ###

First, you will need to fork the GitHub repository of the **craft ai
tutorials**, so that you can manipulate the behaviors and actions.

To do so, go to
[github.com/craft-ai/Tutorials](https://github.com/craft-ai/Tutorials), log in
with your GitHub account and click on the **Fork** button, in the top right
corner of the page.

### User configuration ###

The following information will be required to run the web application:

- your GitHub username (more precisely, the owner of your fork of the
**Tutorials** project),
- the name of your fork,
- the branch of your fork you want to use.

### App configuration ###

You will also need to have an _Application ID_ and an _Application secret_ for
your modified version of the tutorials. Those are generated by **craft ai**:

- go to the [craft ai editor](http://editor.craft.ai/),
- log in with your GitHub account - you'll need to have a _beta_ access for this
step to work,
- click on the **add projects** button and check the box on the right of the
project corresponding to your fork of the **Tutorials** project (something along
the lines of `<github_username>/Tutorials`),
- click on the "Add 1 project" button at the bottom of the list. The project will
be added to your workspace and you can select it to start editing it,
- in the project explorer that appears on the left of the page, click on the
**cog** button on the right of the project name.

You will end up on the **settings** page which will display the `Application ID`
and the `Application secret` needed to run the tutorials.

## Running ##

### First launch ###

Open your browser and go to [www.craft.ai/tutorials](http://www.craft.ai/tutorials/) and
click the `Run` button. You will be prompted to fill in a form with the data from
the previous steps.

In the `Behaviors folder` field, put "bts/0". This means that the app will create its agents based on the behavior trees that are present in the folder "bts/0" of the project.

Once submitted, the data will appear in the URL like this:

```
http://www.craft.ai/tutorials
  ?owner=<github_username>
  &project=Tutorials
  &branch=<github_project_branch>
  &folder=bts/0
  &appid=<craft_ai_app_id>
  &appsecret=<craft_ai_app_secret>
```
This way you can save the url and when hitting the "Run" button from there, the form will be
completed with your data and all you will need to do is hit "Submit".

### Playing around ###

You can play around with the app and see what happens. The controls are the following:

  - `Run` will start an instance and display the posts retrieved from reddit in the web page;
  - `Stop` will stop the currently running instance which will prevent retrieving and displaying any more content, and restore the page to its initial state;

### Under the hood ###

Here's how the application works:

1. A **craft ai agent** that we will call the `reddit manager` retrieves the
front page of a given subreddit via the `GetFrontPage` action;
2. If the reddit API returns results, the `reddit manager` will
  - display a summary of the topics returned as thumbnails in the web page,
  - and send the results to the `city manager` agent using
  [craft ai messaging system](http://doc.craft.ai/behaviors/messages/index.html#the-messaging-system);

3. The `city manager` agent will then
  - compare the results' titles with a list of capitals (`GetCapitals` action),
  - and for each capital matched
    - display the thumbnail in a dedicated column (`DisplayCityThumbnail` action),
    - and retrieve the weather and display it on a map (`DisplayCityWeather` action);
4. When all of the results have been run through, the `city manager` agent will notify the `reddit manager` agent;
5. The `reddit manager` agent will send a request for other topics in the subreddit, and the scenario plays again, until no more topics are found.
